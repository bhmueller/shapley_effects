# Tests for econsa's shapley.py and potential improvements

In this repo I write more tests for shapley.py, a method for calculating Shapley effects for quantitative uncertainty analysis.

*shapley.py* implements the algorithm suggested by Song et al. (2016) which in turn came up with an algorithm based on the idea of using Shapley values for global sensitivity analysis introduced by Owen (2014).
